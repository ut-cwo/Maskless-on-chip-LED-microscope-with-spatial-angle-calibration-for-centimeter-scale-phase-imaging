# Lensfree Tissue Section Reconstruction Code

This repository contains the MATLAB and Python (JAX) code used to reconstruct quantitative phase images from raw multi-angle lensfree microscopy datasets described in our manuscript.

Please cite our manuscript if you use this code (details to be added).
